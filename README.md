# Enhancing Credit Risk Assessment
## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance credit risk evaluation for financial institutions using data-driven techniques, including ETL pipelines, predictive modeling, OLAP cubes, and BI dashboards.
It brings together SQL Server, Python, Power BI, and SSIS/SSAS to build a robust framework for identifying high-risk customers and visualizing real-time financial risk trends.

## Repository Structure
Datasets - Raw and processed datasets used for credit risk modeling.

Final_project_ETL - ETL workflows built using SSIS for data extraction, transformation, and loading into SQL Server.

FinalProject_Cube - SSAS cube files for multidimensional analysis of risk-related metrics.

CreditRiskAssessment_Final Project Report.docx - Final project report detailing objectives, methodology, results, and business impact.

Enhancing-Credit-Risk-Assessment.pptx	- Slide deck used to present findings and model recommendations.

FinalProjectAdvDB_Updated.ipynb	Notebook - containing credit scoring logic, feature engineering, and clustering models.

PowerBI Dashboard	- Power BI report providing visual insights into customer risk levels, credit scores, and trends.

FinalProject1.bak	- SQL Server database backup of the final dataset used in the ETL and cube setup.

AdvDBMS DataModel.pdf	- Data model and schema design used during SQL database construction.

## Key Features
